# Qopy Multi-Part Upload Deployment Checklist

## Code Review Complete - Critical Issues Resolved

### Fixed Critical Issues:

#### 1. PostgreSQL Schema Syntax
- **Problem**: INDEX syntax in CREATE TABLE (PostgreSQL-incompatible)
- **Fix**: Created separate CREATE INDEX statements
- **Status**: RESOLVED

#### 2. File Stream Handling
- **Problem**: `await fs.createWriteStream()` - createWriteStream is not async
- **Fix**: Added Promise wrapper for writeStream.end()
- **Status**: RESOLVED

#### 3. XSS Vulnerability
- **Problem**: `data.filename` directly in innerHTML without escaping
- **Fix**: Secure `textContent` for filename display
- **Status**: RESOLVED

#### 4. Race Condition in Database
- **Problem**: Inconsistent order in DELETE FROM with Foreign Keys
- **Fix**: Correct order `file_chunks` before `upload_sessions`
- **Status**: RESOLVED

#### 5. Memory Leak
- **Problem**: `currentUploadSession` not cleared in `cancelUpload`
- **Fix**: Extended cleanup to include session data
- **Status**: RESOLVED

#### 6. Input Validation
- **Problem**: Missing password validation in file upload
- **Fix**: Added password length and empty validation
- **Status**: RESOLVED

git push origin main
```

- [ ] Add PostgreSQL plugin
- [ ] Add Redis plugin (optional)
- [ ] Create Volume storage
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Deploy application

#### 3. Database Migration
**AUTOMATIC** - Migration runs automatically on first server start!

```bash
# No manual steps required!
# Migration executes automatically on app.listen()

# Optional: Check migration manually
railway logs
# Or check local logs for:
# "Multi-part upload database migration completed successfully!"
```

- [ ] All security features active

### Known Limitations & Workarounds

#### File Size Limit
- **Limit**: 100MB per file
- **Workaround**: Configurable via `MAX_FILE_SIZE`

#### Browser Compatibility
- **Requirement**: Modern browsers with Web Crypto API
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers

#### Storage Limitations
- **Railway**: Volume storage up to 100GB
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Railway Volume Permission Error
**Error**: `EACCES: permission denied, mkdir '/app/uploads/chunks'`

**Solution**:
1. **Volume Plugin Setup**:
   - Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Project → Plugins
   - Add "Volume" plugin
   - Note the mount path (e.g., `/var/lib/containers/railwayapp/bind-mounts/f6e63938-971d-40bc-995a-ea148886f6fb/vol_tmztwgoe8c4ndu43`)

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set `RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH` to the exact mount path from step 1
   - Set `RAILWAY_RUN_UID=0` for mkdir permissions
   - Example: 
     ```
     RAILWAY_VOLUME_MOUNT_PATH=/var/lib/containers/railwayapp/bind-mounts/f6e63938-971d-40bc-995a-ea148886f6fb/vol_tmztwgoe8c4ndu43
     RAILWAY_RUN_UID=0
     ```

3. **Restart Deployment**:
   - After setting the environment variables, restart the deployment
   - The server will now use the correct volume path with proper permissions

4. **Verify Setup**:
   - Check logs for: `Storage directories initialized at: [VOLUME_PATH]`
   - Test file upload functionality

#### Database Connection Issues
**Error**: `DATABASE_URL environment variable is required`

**Solution**:
1. Add PostgreSQL plugin in Railway Dashboard
2. `DATABASE_URL` will be automatically set
3. Restart deployment

#### Redis Connection Issues
**Error**: Redis connection failures

**Solution**:
1. Add Redis plugin in Railway Dashboard (optional)
2. `REDIS_URL` will be automatically set
3. Application falls back to in-memory cache if Redis unavailable

### Rollback Plan

#### If deployment fails:
1. **Revert to previous version**:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Database rollback**:
   ```sql
   -- Rollback migration (if needed)
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS upload_sessions CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS file_chunks CASCADE;
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS upload_statistics CASCADE;
   -- Remove added columns from clips table if needed
   ```

3. **Manual cleanup**:
   - Remove volume storage
   - Clear Redis cache
   - Reset environment variables
