            <h2>14. Rate Limiting and IP Processing</h2>
            
            <h3>14.1 Rate Limiting System</h3>
            <p>Qopy implements a multi-layered IP-based rate limiting system to prevent abuse and ensure fair service usage for all users. This system helps protect against spam, automated attacks, and service overload.</p>
            
            <h3>14.2 How Rate Limiting Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP Address Processing:</strong> When you access our service, we temporarily process your IP address to enforce rate limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Limits:</strong> The system enforces different limits for different types of requests:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Burst protection: 30 requests per IP per minute</li>
                        <li>General API protection: 100 requests per IP per 15 minutes</li>
                        <li>Share API protection: 20 share requests per IP per 15 minutes</li>
                        <li>Retrieval API protection: 50 retrieval requests per IP per 15 minutes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Temporary Storage:</strong> IP addresses are only processed in memory for the duration of the rate limiting window and are not permanently stored.</li>
                <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> Rate limiting data is not used for user tracking, analytics, or any other purpose beyond preventing abuse.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>14.3 Rate Limit Exemptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Health check endpoints (/health, /api/health, /ping) are exempt from rate limiting.</li>
                <li><strong>Admin Endpoints:</strong> Admin endpoints are protected by authentication rather than rate limiting.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>14.4 Rate Limit Responses</h3>
            <p>When rate limits are exceeded, the service returns a 429 "Too Many Requests" status code with information about the limits and when they reset. This helps users understand and adjust their usage patterns.</p>
