            <div class="date-info">
                <strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 2025<br>
                <strong>Last Updated:</strong> February 2026
            </div>

            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Qopy ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when you use our enterprise-grade secure text and file sharing service (the "Service"). Qopy is a web-based, open-source text and file sharing platform that prioritizes privacy and security through zero-knowledge client-side encryption with hybrid security architecture.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Shared Content</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What we collect:</strong> Qopy allows you to share text content and files temporarily through our web service.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise-grade client-side encryption:</strong> All content is encrypted in your browser using AES-256-GCM with PBKDF2 key derivation before being transmitted to our servers.</li>
                <li><strong>Zero-knowledge architecture:</strong> We literally cannot see your plain text content - only encrypted data is stored in our database.</li>
                <li><strong>Hybrid security:</strong> URL secrets and passwords are combined for defense in depth protection.</li>
                <li><strong>Duration:</strong> Content is automatically deleted after your chosen expiration time (5 minutes to 24 hours).</li>
                <li><strong>Quick Share mode:</strong> 6-character codes for ultra-fast sharing with zero-knowledge encryption.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Service Usage Data</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Anonymous statistics:</strong> We collect basic, anonymous usage statistics (number of clips created, access patterns) to improve our service.</li>
                <li><strong>No content analysis:</strong> We never analyze, read, or mine the content you share.</li>
                <li><strong>Rate limiting data:</strong> We temporarily process IP addresses for rate limiting purposes to prevent abuse and ensure fair service usage. This data is not stored permanently and is only used to enforce usage limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Error reporting:</strong> In the event of service errors, anonymous diagnostic information may be collected to help resolve issues.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 What the Server Never Sees</h3>
            <p>Due to Qopy's zero-knowledge architecture, the following data never reaches the server:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Plaintext content:</strong> All content is encrypted client-side before upload. The server only stores ciphertext.</li>
                <li><strong>Real filenames:</strong> Replaced with a random hash (e.g. <code>a7f3b2c9</code>) on the client before upload.</li>
                <li><strong>Real MIME types:</strong> Encrypted inside the file payload. The server only sees <code>application/octet-stream</code> or <code>text/plain</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Passwords or access codes:</strong> Only a bcrypt hash is stored; the plaintext password never reaches the server.</li>
                <li><strong>URL secrets:</strong> Kept in the URL fragment (<code>#</code>), which browsers never transmit to the server.</li>
                <li><strong>Decryption keys:</strong> Generated and used exclusively in your browser.</li>
                <li><strong>IP addresses:</strong> Processed in-memory for rate limiting only. Never stored in the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Browser information:</strong> Not collected or stored. No user-agent logging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>Qopy is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately.</p>

            <h2>14. Rate Limiting and IP Processing</h2>
            
            <h3>14.1 Rate Limiting System</h3>
            <p>Qopy implements a multi-layered IP-based rate limiting system to prevent abuse and ensure fair service usage for all users. This system helps protect against spam, automated attacks, and service overload.</p>
            
            <h3>14.2 How Rate Limiting Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>IP Address Processing:</strong> When you access our service, we temporarily process your IP address to enforce rate limits.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage Limits:</strong> The system enforces different limits for different types of requests:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Burst protection: 30 requests per IP per minute</li>
                        <li>General API protection: 100 requests per IP per 15 minutes</li>
                        <li>Share API protection: 20 share requests per IP per 15 minutes</li>
                        <li>Retrieval API protection: 50 retrieval requests per IP per 15 minutes</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Temporary Storage:</strong> IP addresses are only processed in memory for the duration of the rate limiting window and are not permanently stored.</li>
                <li><strong>No Tracking:</strong> Rate limiting data is not used for user tracking, analytics, or any other purpose beyond preventing abuse.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>14.3 Rate Limit Exemptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Health Checks:</strong> Health check endpoints (/health, /api/health, /ping) are exempt from rate limiting.</li>
                <li><strong>Admin Endpoints:</strong> Admin endpoints are protected by authentication rather than rate limiting.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>14.4 Rate Limit Responses</h3>
            <p>When rate limits are exceeded, the service returns a 429 "Too Many Requests" status code with information about the limits and when they reset. This helps users understand and adjust their usage patterns.</p>

            <h2>15. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
            <p>Qopy is a web application that does not use cookies, local storage for tracking, analytics scripts, tracking pixels, or any other tracking technologies. No third-party scripts are loaded. QR codes are generated locally in your browser without external API calls.</p>

            <h2>16. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Qopy may integrate with third-party services for specific functionality. These services have their own privacy policies, and we encourage you to review them. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services.</p>

            <h2>17. Data Minimization</h2>
            <p>We follow the principle of data minimization, collecting only the information necessary to provide our services. We do not collect unnecessary personal information and regularly review our data collection practices to ensure compliance with this principle.</p>

            <h2>18. Security Best Practices</h2>
            <p>To protect your privacy and security when using Qopy:</p>
