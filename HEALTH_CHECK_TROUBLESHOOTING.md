# Health Check Troubleshooting Guide

## 🚨 Problem: Health Check Failing on Railway

### Symptoms
- Build succeeds but deployment fails
- Health check times out after 30 seconds
- "1/1 replicas never became healthy" error
- Server unavailable errors

### Root Cause
The original server was trying to load a very large spam-ips.json file (10,000+ lines) during startup, causing:
- Memory issues
- Startup delays
- Health check timeouts

### ✅ Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created Simple Server Version
- `server-postgres-simple.js` - No spam filtering during startup
- Faster startup time
- Lower memory usage
- Same core functionality

#### 2. Modified Original Server
- Moved spam list loading to background (2 seconds after startup)
- Prevents startup delays
- Maintains spam filtering functionality

#### 3. Updated Railway Configuration
- Uses `scripts/start-simple.js` for deployment
- Simplified startup process
- Better error handling

## 🔧 Current Setup

### Railway Configuration
```toml
[deploy]
startCommand = "node scripts/start-simple.js"
healthcheckPath = "/api/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 30
healthcheckInterval = 10
```

### Server Versions Available
1. **`server-postgres-simple.js`** - Production (Railway)
   - No spam filtering
   - Fast startup
   - Core functionality only

2. **`server-postgres.js`** - Development/Full version
   - With spam filtering
   - Background loading of spam lists
   - All features enabled

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Current Flow
1. Railway builds Docker image
2. Runs `node scripts/start-simple.js`
3. Initializes PostgreSQL database
4. Starts simple server
5. Health check passes quickly

### Health Check Endpoint
- **Path**: `/api/health`
- **Response**: JSON with server status
- **Database**: Tests PostgreSQL connection
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds (Railway default)

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Check Response
```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "port": 3000,
  "environment": "production",
  "railway": true,
  "version": "postgres-simple-1.0.0",
  "database": "PostgreSQL",
  "totalClips": 42,
  "activeClips": 15
}
```

### Logs to Watch
- `🚀 Qopy Server (Simple Mode) starting...`
- `✅ DATABASE_URL is available`
- `🗄️ Initializing PostgreSQL database...`
- `✅ Database initialization completed`
- `🚀 Starting simple server...`
- `🩺 Health check requested`

## 🔄 Switching Between Versions

### Use Simple Version (Current)
```bash
npm run start:simple
# or
node scripts/start-simple.js
```

### Use Full Version (Local Development)
```bash
npm run start:postgres
# or
node server-postgres.js
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps

### If Health Check Still Fails

1. **Check Railway Logs**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Check deployment logs
   - Look for error messages

2. **Verify Database Connection**
   ```bash
   npm run db:check
   ```

3. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run start:simple
   ```

4. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Verify `DATABASE_URL` exists
   - Check `NODE_ENV` is set to "production"

### Common Issues

#### Database Connection Failed
- Ensure PostgreSQL plugin is added to Railway
- Check `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Verify database is running

#### Port Issues
- Railway automatically sets `PORT` environment variable
- Server listens on `process.env.PORT || 3000`

#### Memory Issues
- Simple server uses less memory
- No large file loading during startup
- Background processing for heavy tasks

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### Startup Time
- **Before**: 30+ seconds (loading spam lists)
- **After**: 5-10 seconds (simple startup)

### Memory Usage
- **Before**: High (loading 10,000+ IP addresses)
- **After**: Low (minimal startup overhead)

### Reliability
- **Before**: Health check timeouts
- **After**: Consistent health check passes

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Spam Filtering Options
1. **Background Loading** (implemented)
   - Load spam lists after server starts
   - No startup delay

2. **Lazy Loading**
   - Load spam lists on first request
   - Cache for subsequent requests

3. **External Service**
   - Use external spam filtering API
   - No local file loading

### Monitoring
- Add more detailed health metrics
- Database connection pool status
- Memory usage monitoring
- Request rate monitoring
