## Critical Test Scenarios

### File Size Boundaries (Primary Focus)
The tests specifically verify the fix for the 5MB boundary issue:

1. **4.9MB File**: Should create exactly 1 chunk, assemble correctly
2. **5.0MB File**: Should create exactly 1 chunk (at threshold), assemble correctly
3. **5.1MB File**: Should create exactly 2 chunks (over threshold), assemble correctly

### Encryption + Chunking Integration
Verifies that encryption settings are preserved throughout the chunking process:
- Access code hashes maintained
- Quick Share secrets preserved
- Zero-knowledge metadata creation
- File integrity through encryption

### Performance Benchmarks
Establishes performance expectations:
- Assembly time limits by file size
- Memory usage constraints
- Throughput minimums (25MB/s)
- Concurrent operation handling

### Security Validation
Ensures security is maintained with chunking:
- Path traversal prevention
- Chunk tampering detection
- Resource exhaustion protection
- Secure cleanup procedures

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides comprehensive coverage of:
- ✅ **File size boundaries** (4.9MB, 5MB, 5.1MB, 10MB, 50MB, 100MB)
- ✅ **Chunk count variations** (1-100 chunks)
- ✅ **Encryption integration** (access codes, Quick Share, zero-knowledge)

## Expected Results

When the 5MB boundary fix is working correctly:
- 4.9MB files should create 1 chunk and assemble successfully
- 5.0MB files should create 1 chunk and assemble successfully  
- 5.1MB files should create 2 chunks and assemble successfully
- All encryption settings should be preserved
- Performance should meet established benchmarks
- Security protections should prevent attacks
- Recovery should work for all failure scenarios

## Integration with CI/CD

These tests are designed to:
- Run in automated test pipelines
- Validate fixes before deployment
- Prevent regression of the 5MB boundary issue
- Ensure performance and security standards
- Provide clear failure diagnostics

The comprehensive test suite ensures the chunk upload feature works correctly across all critical scenarios and file sizes.
