## 🔍 User Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Railway Deployment Status

**What to verify:**
1. Go to your Railway dashboard
2. Confirm the `dev_zero` branch is configured for auto-deployment
3. Check if deployment was triggered by the latest commit
4. Verify deployment logs show successful build

**Expected outcome:** Deployment should be live with commit `088f5a8`

### Step 2: Visual Theme Verification

**Buy Me a Coffee Button:**
```css
/* Should now have purple theme matching Railway button */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #360f5a 0%, #4a1478 100%);
color: white;
border: 2px solid #360f5a;
```

**Railway Deploy Button:**
```css
/* Should match the same purple theme */
background: linear-gradient(135deg, #360f5a 0%, #4a1478 100%);
color: white;
```

**What to verify:**
1. Visit your live Railway URL
2. Scroll to footer section
3. Confirm both buttons have consistent purple styling
4. Test hover effects on both buttons
5. Verify buttons look professional and cohesive

### Step 3: Core Functionality Testing

**Text Sharing:**

# Test these endpoints on your live Railway URL
curl https://your-app.railway.app/health          # Should return 200 OK
curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/health      # Should return 200 OK with DB status
curl https://your-app.railway.app/ping           # Should return 200 OK
```

**Load Testing:**
- [ ] Test with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Verify database connections are stable
- [ ] Check memory usage remains reasonable
- [ ] Confirm no memory leaks during extended use

### Step 5: Security Validation

- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is functional

**Data Protection:**
- [ ] Client-side encryption works
- [ ] No sensitive data in browser network logs
- [ ] Temporary files are cleaned up
- [ ] Database queries use parameterized statements
