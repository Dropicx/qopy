- ✅ Timeout and resource exhaustion
- ✅ Circular reference handling

### 3. Performance Testing
- ✅ Response time validation (<100ms for most operations)
- ✅ Concurrent operation handling (10+ simultaneous requests)
- ✅ Memory usage monitoring
- ✅ Large data handling (10KB+ content)

### 4. Security Testing
- ✅ Input sanitization
- ✅ Access code validation
- ✅ File path traversal prevention
- ✅ Encryption parameter validation

### 5. Edge Case Testing
- ✅ Empty and null inputs
- ✅ Boundary value testing
- ✅ Special character handling
- ✅ Large file processing
- ✅ Network interruption scenarios

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific service tests
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run with custom test runner
node run-tests.js
```

### Test Results Format
- JSON report: `test-results/test-report.json`
- HTML report: `test-results/test-report.html`
- Coverage report: `coverage/index.html`

## Backward Compatibility

### Legacy System Support
- ✅ Old file upload system compatibility
- ✅ Legacy request format parsing
- ✅ Gradual migration path validation
- ✅ Mixed system operation testing

### API Endpoint Compatibility
- ✅ `/api/upload/complete/:uploadId` workflow
- ✅ `/api/share` endpoint validation
- ✅ `/api/file/:clipId` access patterns

## Key Testing Achievements

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- **333 unit tests** across 6 core services
