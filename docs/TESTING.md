## Chunk Upload Testing

### Test Suite Structure

#### 1. chunk-upload-integration.test.js
**Focus**: Critical file size boundaries and core functionality

**Key Test Categories**:
- **Critical File Size Boundaries**:
  - 4.9MB (under 5MB threshold) - should create 1 chunk
  - 5MB (exactly at threshold) - should create 1 chunk  
  - 5.1MB (just over threshold) - should create 2 chunks
  - 10MB (double threshold) - should create 2 chunks
  - 50MB (large multi-chunk) - should create 10 chunks

#### 2. chunk-upload-performance.test.js
**Focus**: Speed, memory efficiency, and concurrent processing

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- Small files (<5MB): <100ms assembly time
- Medium files (5-20MB): <500ms assembly time
- Large files (20-100MB): <2s assembly time
- Throughput validation: >25MB/s minimum

#### 3. chunk-upload-security.test.js
**Focus**: Security vulnerabilities and attack prevention

**Security Tests**:
- Path traversal protection
- Chunk integrity validation
- Access control enforcement
- Resource exhaustion prevention

#### 4. chunk-upload-recovery.test.js
**Focus**: Failure scenarios and system recovery

**Recovery Scenarios**:
- Zero and small file edge cases
- Partial upload recovery
- Disk space limitations
- System restart recovery

#### 5. chunk-upload-basic.test.js
**Focus**: Core functionality without database dependencies

### Running Chunk Upload Tests
```bash
# Full test suite (requires database)
npm test tests/integration/chunk-upload-*.test.js

# Basic tests (no database required)
npm test tests/integration/chunk-upload-basic.test.js

# Specific test file
npm test tests/integration/chunk-upload-security.test.js
```
