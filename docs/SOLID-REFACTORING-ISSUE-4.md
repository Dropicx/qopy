# SOLID Refactoring - Issue #4 Documentation

## Overview
This document captures the reasoning and approach for refactoring the `file-upload.js` monolith to follow SOLID principles, as requested in GitHub Issue #4.

## Problem Statement
The original `file-upload.js` was a 2,710-line monolithic class that violated all five SOLID principles:
- **Single Responsibility**: One class handling UI, encryption, networking, file processing, and state management
- **Open/Closed**: Hard-coded encryption modes requiring class modification for extensions
- **Liskov Substitution**: Incompatible interfaces preventing interchangeable usage
- **Interface Segregation**: No interfaces, forcing dependencies on all 40+ methods
- **Dependency Inversion**: Direct coupling to DOM, crypto APIs, and concrete implementations

## Solution Architecture

### Service Separation
We decomposed the monolith into focused services:

1. **CryptoService**: Handles all encryption/decryption operations
   - Strategy pattern for different encryption modes
   - Zero-knowledge encryption support
   - Extensible for new algorithms

2. **NetworkService**: Manages HTTP communications
   - Chunked uploads with resume capability
   - Progress tracking and cancellation
   - Error recovery with exponential backoff

3. **FileProcessor**: File operations and chunking
   - Configurable chunk sizes
   - File validation and metadata extraction
   - Hash generation for integrity

4. **UIController**: UI state management only
   - Event-driven updates
   - No business logic
   - Clean separation of concerns

5. **EventBus**: Decoupled communication
   - Observer pattern implementation
   - Priority-based event handling
   - Debugging and history tracking

### Dependency Injection
- ServiceFactory provides dependency injection container
- Constructor injection for all services
- Interface-based contracts between components
- Easy testing and mocking

### SOLID Compliance Achieved

#### Single Responsibility Principle
- Each service has one clear responsibility
- UIController only handles UI updates
- CryptoService only handles encryption
- NetworkService only handles HTTP operations

#### Open/Closed Principle
- Strategy pattern for encryption algorithms
- New encryption modes added without modifying existing code
- Configuration-based behavior changes

#### Liskov Substitution Principle
- All services implement clear interfaces
- Components are interchangeable
- Mock implementations for testing

#### Interface Segregation Principle
- Focused interfaces per domain
- Clients depend only on methods they use
- No "fat" interfaces

#### Dependency Inversion Principle
- Services depend on abstractions (interfaces)
- High-level modules don't depend on low-level details
- Dependency injection for flexibility

## Benefits Achieved

### Maintainability
- Code is organized into logical, focused modules
- Each service can be understood independently
- Clear separation of concerns

### Testability
- Each service can be unit tested in isolation
- Dependency injection enables comprehensive mocking
- 85%+ test coverage achievable

### Extensibility
- New features added without modifying existing code
- Strategy pattern allows new encryption modes
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

### Performance
- Reduced file sizes through modularization
- Better code splitting opportunities
- Efficient chunked uploads with resume capability

## Migration Path
The refactored solution maintains backward compatibility with existing server-side services while providing a clean foundation for future enhancements. The modular architecture allows gradual migration and testing of individual components.

## Conclusion
This refactoring transforms an unmaintainable monolith into a well-architected, SOLID-compliant system that will serve as a robust foundation for Qopy's file upload capabilities for years to come.
